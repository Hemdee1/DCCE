          <strong>CCE510: PROJECT AND SEMINAR II (4 UNITS)</strong>
          This course lasts for one academic session.  Each student or group of
          students must undertake a project under the supervision of a lecturer,
          submit a comprehensive project report and present  seminar(s) at the
          end of the year.  A project status report is to be presented with an
          appraisal seminar at the end of the first semester.  Each student must
          attend Engineering Seminars.
