          The Bachelor of Engineering (B. Eng.) course in Computer and
          Communications Engineering normally last for five (5) academic years
          (100 to 500 Levels). However, direct entry candidates spend four (4)
          academic years. The course is structured in such a way that all
          Engineering students offer the same basic courses at 100 to 300 levels
          in order to prepare them for the Engineering profession. The 400 and
          500 level courses are more detailed and focused towards professional
          training in Computer and Communications Engineering. 
          <br />A student cannot stay beyond 150% of the normal course duration
          i.e. 7½ academic sessions.
